# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  bio    : "I am a PhD candidate in marine ecology at Åbo Akademi University. My research focuses on the effects of ship-traffic–induced physical disturbance on coastal habitat forming macroalgae in the Baltic Sea. I have a Finnish professional qualification in scientific diving and have worked at the sea doing underwater inventories every summer since 2019 until the start of my PhD when the scope changed into underwater data collection for my research. In 2025 I started a small print-on-demand brand called Baltic Sea Art as I was searching new ways to introduce the beauty and importance of the Baltic Sea to the public and engage in conservation. Buying from Baltic Sea Art people can participate in conservation as 25 % of profit goes to Baltic Sea conservation efforts of Baltic Sea Action Group."
