# How ferry waves affect reproductive effort of bladderwrack? 
I study how ferry waves affect reproductive effort (investment in receptacles) of bladderwrack. The species requires periods of low water motion for gamete release, conditions that may be limited near shipping lanes. We collected samples of receptacles bearing algae and calculated the share of receptacles in relation to growth tips. In addition we took dry weight of receptacles and assessed sex ratio of randomly collected receptacles.

# How ferry waves affect recruitment success of bladderwrack?
Large ship-generated waves constitute a chronic physical disturbance in coastal areas. They modify flow velocity, sediment dynamics and light availability. The species requires calm windows and clean substrates for juvenile attachment. Recruitment success was assessed using settlement tiles and calculating the number of attached algae.

# How ferry waves affect growth of bladderwrack?
We collected algae from our sites and in next two days we had to put them back cut, measured and attached to tiles. We had long days but eventually succeeded to get all tips back to sites on time. We wait couple of weeks and see if ferries affect growth of the tips.

# How ferry waves affect vertical distribution of bladderwrack? 
We did transect diving to see in what depth are the shallow and deep limits of a continuous bladderwrack belt as well as optimum depth in our impact and control sites. I also recorded information about sedimentation, loose laying filamentous algae, other algae species and seabed substrates.

# Retrieving loggers from the field
Large ship-generated waves constitute a chronic physical disturbance in coastal areas modifying flow velocity, sediment dynamics and light availability. We put pressure-temperature, accaleration and light loggers to all our sites. Also, we had sediment traps in our sites to measure sedimentation rate.
