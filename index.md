*My study area in the Archipelago Sea with a ferry arriving from Turku on the right side of the image.*

I am a PhD candidate in marine biology at Åbo Akademi University. My research focuses on the effects of ship-traffic–induced physical disturbance on coastal habitat forming macroalgae in the Baltic Sea.

# Scientific diving

*I love diving and the underwater world!*

I have a Finnish professional qualification in scientific diving and have worked at the sea doing underwater inventories every summer since 2019 until the start of my PhD when the scope changed into underwater data collection for my research.

# Baltic Sea Art

*The website of Baltic Sea Art [Link to webshop](https://balticseaart.myshopify.com)*

In 2025 I started a small print-on-demand brand called Baltic Sea Art as I was searching new ways to introduce the beauty and importance of the Baltic Sea to the public and engage in conservation. I draw different species of the Baltic Sea and design products with them. In the website I tell about the species and the state of the Baltic Sea in general. Buying from Baltic Sea Art people can participate in conservation as 25 % of profit goes to Baltic Sea conservation efforts of Baltic Sea Action Group.
